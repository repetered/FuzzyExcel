# FuzzyExcel
An excel workbook that uses the ChatGPT API to let you map an unstructured / unformatted data set to a structured / formatted data set.

I built this because data conversions often involve mapping data from one or many 'code tables' to another 'code table'.  This tool essentially replicates the capablilites of the Fuzzy Lookup function.
